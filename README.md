# 2pSAM_recon
This repository demonstrates the whole reconstruction pipeline for two-photon synthetic aperture microscopy (2pSAM) with digital adaptive optics (DAO).

We used the experimentally captured data of microglia dynamic in the cortex of CX3CR1 mice as a demo to show the 3D reconstruction process with the high-resolution 3D volume
and estimated aberration wavefront as the output. We have also included the codes to generate the point spread functions with default parameters based on the experimental system.
